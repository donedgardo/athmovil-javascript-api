# ATH Móvil Payment Button - Javascript Integration and Services

## Introduction
ATH Móvil's Javascript integration provides a simple, secure and fast checkout experience to customers paying on your website. After integrating our Payment Button on your website, you will be able to receive instant payments from more than a million ATH Móvil users.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, please review the following prerequisites:

* An active ATH Móvil Business account is required to continue.
Note: *To sign up, download "ATH Móvil Business"x on the App Store if you have an iOS device or on the Play Store if you have an Android device.*

* Your ATH Móvil Business account needs to have a registered, verified and active ATH® card.

* Have the public and private API keys of your Business account at hand. Note: *You can view your API keys on the settings section of the ATH Móvil Business application for iOS or Android.*

If you need help signing up, adding a card or have any other question please refer to https://athmovilbusiness.com/preguntas or contact our support team at (787) 773-5466.

## Installation
Before getting started you will need to add references to both jQuery and ATH Móvil's javascript on your project's HTML checkout file.
```javascript
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
```
```javascript
<script src="https://www.athmovil.com/api/js/v2/athmovilV2.js"></script>
```
*Notes:*
* *ATH Móvil's javascript must be referenced at the bottom of the document since some variables need to be previously initialized.*
* *jQuery can be referenced on any location. Local versions can also be used. Version 3.3.1 or higher is required.*

## Usage
To integrate ATH Móvil’s Payment Button on your website follow these steps:

### HTML
Add the “Pay with ATH Móvil” button to your checkout view.
```html
  <div id="ATHMovil_Checkout_Button"></div>
```
* Button width is set to fill its parent.
* Button height is proportional to the width.

---

### Javascript
Configure the payment values using the javascript script below on your checkout view.
```javascript
<script type="text/javascript">

    ATHM_Checkout = {

        env: 'sandbox',
        publicToken: 'sandboxtoken01875617264',

        timeout: 600,
